## What pyPrep needs

For each tilt series, pyPrep needs:

1. **An `.mdoc` file** written by the microscope software during collection —
   Thermo Fisher **Tomo5** or **SerialEM**. It supplies the tilt angles, the
   order they were collected in, the dose, pixel size, voltage and tilt-axis
   angle, and the name of each tilt's movie file (`SubFramePath`).
2. **The movie / dose-fraction file of every tilt**:
   - MRC fraction files (Tomo5 K3 8-bit fractions, or any MRC mode),
   - TIFF frame stacks,
   - Falcon **EER** files.

The fraction files can be next to the `.mdoc` (or in a `frames` subfolder), or
in a separate folder (for example the `DoseFractions` share) that you give as
the **Fractions folder**. Files are matched by the name in `SubFramePath`
(case-insensitive); Tomo5-style names (`<name>_<nnn>_<angle>_…`) are also
matched by acquisition number.

Missing fraction files are listed and those tilts are skipped — the rest of the
series is still processed.

## The window

![Tilt series page](images/tilt_series.png)

- **Top bar** (all pages): the **Session** folder containing the `.mdoc` files,
  the **Output** folder (one subfolder per tilt series is created in it), and
  **Find tilt series**. Tick **Subfolders** to search the session folder
  recursively.
- **Left bar**: the pages, and at the bottom the **Batch** panel with progress,
  **Start** and **Cancel**.
- **Status bar**: the GPU in use and the IMOD version found.

Folders and all settings are remembered between sessions.

## Tilt series page

After **Find tilt series**, the upper table lists every tilt series:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Tilt series | name (from the `.mdoc`); the checkbox selects it for processing |
| Tilts / Missing | tilts in the mdoc / tilts whose fraction file was not found |
| QC | number of tilts flagged by [quality control](#quality-control), and `sat x%` if the fraction files are saturated |
| Range, Pixel | tilt range (degrees) and pixel size (Å) from the mdoc |
| Stacks | `ready`, `queued`, `running n/N`, `done`, `failed` |
| Tomogram | the same for the IMOD reconstruction (`-` if reconstruction is off) |
| Time | processing time of the last run |

Select a series to see its tilts in the lower table, sorted by tilt angle, with
the acquisition number, dose, dose received before the tilt, QC flags (hover
for the reason) and the fraction file (missing files in yellow). **Untick a
tilt** to leave it out of this series' stacks (e.g. a tilt blocked by a grid
bar), or press **Exclude flagged tilts**. Changing which tilts are used marks
the series' stacks and tomogram as out of date, so the next **Start** rebuilds
them.

### Quality control

pyPrep flags tilts that would degrade a reconstruction:

| Flag | Meaning | Checked |
|---|---|---|
| `dark` | much less intensity than expected for its tilt angle — grid bar, lamella edge, contamination, thick ice | from the mdoc when the series is found, and again from the data after processing |
| `bright` | much more intensity than expected (e.g. the beam partly over a hole) — informational | same |
| `drift` | frame drift far above the rest of the series | after processing |
| `low score` | frame alignment correlation below half the series median | after processing |
| `not converged` | frame alignment hit the iteration limit — informational | after processing |

The expected intensity follows the specimen thickness along the beam, which
grows as 1/cos(tilt); pyPrep fits this (allowing for a tilted specimen) and
flags tilts more than ~15 % below it. Flagged tilts are *not* removed
automatically — **Exclude flagged tilts** unticks the `dark`, `drift` and
`low score` ones. The Results page plots the intensity of every tilt against
the fitted curve.

pyPrep also reports **saturation**: Tomo5 can save 8-bit fraction files, which
clip any pixel that receives more than ~8 electrons in one fraction. If more
than 0.5 % of pixels are at 255, the QC column shows `sat x%` and the log
explains. The counts lost cannot be recovered; save fractions as 16-bit, or use
more, shorter fractions, at the microscope.

**Test on one tilt** aligns the selected tilt (or the one nearest 0° if none is
selected) with the current settings and shows unaligned vs aligned on the
Results page. Nothing is written to disk — use it to check settings, and for
EER data to check the gain reference.

## Frame alignment page

![Frame alignment page](images/frame_alignment.png)

### Input frames

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| EER grouping | 10 fractions | EER files hold hundreds of detector frames per tilt. They are summed into this many *fractions* before alignment (or choose *EER frames per fraction*). Each fraction should have enough dose to align, roughly 0.2–0.5 e/Å². No frames are dropped. |
| EER rendering | Physical pixels (4K) | *2x super-resolution (8K)* uses the EER sub-pixel positions; frames are aligned at 8K and Fourier-binned back to the physical pixel size (less aliasing, ~4x slower). Output pixel sizes are unchanged. |
| Gain reference | none | Needed for **EER** (Falcon frames are not gain-corrected): use the `.gain` file EPU writes. **Not needed for Tomo5 K3 fractions**, which are already gain-normalized. MRC and TIFF references are also accepted; DigitalMicrograph `.dm4` must first be converted with IMOD's `dm2mrc`. |
| Gain handling | Auto, rotate 0°, no flip | *Auto* divides by `.gain` files / for EER movies and multiplies otherwise. If the reference is in a different orientation from the frames, set the rotation/flip (pyPrep reports a size mismatch, and suggests a rotation when the reference looks transposed). |

### Alignment

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Alignment binning | 4 | Frames are Fourier-binned by this factor to *measure* shifts. Low-dose tomography fractions share signal mostly coarser than ~30 Å, so 4 is appropriate; shifts are still *applied* at full resolution. |
| B-factor | 500 Å² | Low-pass on the cross-correlation. Increase (1000–2000) for very noisy fractions. |
| Max shift | 80 px | Largest shift searched, in full-resolution (physical) pixels. |
| Max iterations / Tolerance | 10 / 0.1 px | Refinement stops when no shift changes by more than the tolerance. |
| Group frames | 1 | Sum this many consecutive frames before aligning (for very noisy movies); per-frame shifts are interpolated. |
| Ignore detector fixed-pattern noise | on | Camera row/column offsets are identical in every frame and pull all shifts to zero; pyPrep ignores the Fourier axes where they live. Leave on. |

### CTF estimation

pyPrep measures the defocus of every tilt on the GPU, from the tilt's aligned
sum, while the series is processed. This adds about 15 s per series. The fit
takes into account that tilted images are not at one defocus. It also finds:

- which side of the image is further from focus (the *handedness*);
- how far the specimen is tilted relative to the stage angles.

The results feed CTF correction and deconvolution (Reconstruction page). They
are written as `<series>.defocus` for IMOD and shown on the Results page.

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Estimate the CTF of every tilt | on | For series whose stacks already exist, the CTF is estimated from the bin 1 aligned stack when the batch is re-run. |
| Spherical aberration | 2.7 mm | Titan Krios / Glacios: 2.7. |
| Amplitude contrast | 0.07 | Typical for cryo samples. |
| Fit range | 30 to 8 Å | The high-resolution end is limited to 2.2 × the pixel size. |
| Defocus search | 0.5 to 12 µm | Underfocus. |

## Outputs page

![Outputs page](images/outputs.png)

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Aligned sum | on | `<name>.mrc`: the motion-corrected sum — the normal input for etomo. |
| Even / odd half-sums | off | `<name>_EVN.mrc`, `<name>_ODD.mrc`: sums of alternate frames, for noise2noise denoising (cryoCARE, Topaz-Denoise) — reconstruct each with the same alignment. |
| Dose-weighted sum | off | `<name>_DW.mrc`: exposure-filtered (Grant & Grigorieff). Do **not** also apply etomo's dose weighting to it. |
| Binning levels | bin 1 + bin 4 | Each selected stack is written at each binning (`_bin4.mrc` etc.), by Fourier cropping. |
| Data type | float32 | int16 halves the file size and is lossless in practice for counting-camera data. |
| Exclude angles | — | Tilt angles (within 0.5°) left out of every series. Per-series exclusions: untick tilts on the Tilt series page. |
| Compute on | GPU 0 | or CPU (much slower). |
| Skip steps whose outputs are already complete | on | Re-running a batch skips finished stacks/tomograms, so an interrupted batch resumes. Turn off to redo everything. |
| Fallback dose per tilt | 0 | Used only for dose weighting when the mdoc has no `ExposureDose`. |

**Presets and settings files**: a *preset* stores the settings of all pages
under a name — for example one per microscope and camera. Pick a preset and
press *Apply*, or *Save as preset…* to store the current settings (presets live
in `%APPDATA%\pyPrep\presets`). *Save settings* writes the same thing to a
JSON file you can share or give to the command line (`--settings`).

## Reconstruction page

![Reconstruction page](images/reconstruction.png)

With **Reconstruct each series with IMOD batchruntomo** ticked (the default),
pyPrep runs IMOD's batchruntomo on each series after frame alignment. The line
at the top shows whether IMOD was found.

**Alignment preset**

- **Patch tracking (no gold)** — default. Tracks overlapping patches through
  the series; no fiducials needed. *Patch size* 400 nm and *overlap* 0.6 match
  a hand-tuned etomo project (1200 px patches at 3.3 Å).
- **Gold fiducials** — automatic bead seeding (autofidseed) and tracking,
  with gold erasing. *Bead size* 10 nm, *beads to track* 20.

**Tomogram**

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Stack binning | bin 4 | Which pyPrep stack is reconstructed (written automatically even if not ticked on the Outputs page). |
| Stack | Aligned sum | or the dose-weighted sum. |
| Positioning | Automatic | IMOD cryo-positioning finds the specimen slab and sets thickness and pitch. Sparse specimens (isolated particles, thin films) can defeat it; the *Fallback thickness* is then used and a warning is logged. *Fixed thickness* skips positioning. |
| Positioning thickness | 330 nm | Thickness of the trial tomogram used for positioning. |
| Fallback / fixed thickness | 200 nm | |
| Handedness | Automatic | See below. *Keep as recorded* uses the tilt axis from the mdoc; *Always flip* rotates it by 180°. |
| SIRT-like filter | 6 | Radial filter equivalent to this many SIRT iterations (better low-resolution contrast); 0 = plain weighted back-projection. |
| CPU cores, GPU | all but one core, off | GPU back-projection needs a CUDA-enabled IMOD. |
| Remove X-rays | on | ccderaser on the stack. |

**Handedness.** If the tilt-angle sign, the tilt-axis angle or the image
orientation are not what IMOD assumes, the tomogram comes out as a mirror
image. This does not matter for segmentation or measuring shapes. It does
matter for subtomogram averaging, for helices, and for anything chiral.

CTF estimation detects this from the direction of the defocus gradient. With
*Automatic*, pyPrep then reconstructs with the tilt axis rotated by 180°,
which gives the correct handedness. It does this when at least 80% of the
tilts beyond 20° agree. The stacks' `.mrc.mdoc` files get the corrected tilt
axis too, so an etomo project you set up by hand agrees. The Results page
shows *handedness corrected* when this applies.

A corrected tomogram is the point mirror of an uncorrected one: rotated 180°
in XY and flipped in Z. Tomograms made before the correction (or by etomo
from the original mdoc) therefore look rotated by 180° compared with new
ones. When the decision changes, a series' tomogram is out of date and is
reconstructed again on the next run.

**CTF correction and deconvolution**

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Correct the CTF | on | IMOD ctfphaseflip phase-flips the aligned stack with pyPrep's per-tilt defocus. At bin 4 with ~2–3 µm defocus the first CTF zero is near Nyquist, so it changes little. It matters for bin 1–2 tomograms. |
| Also write a deconvolved tomogram | on | `<series>_rec_deconv.mrc`: a Wiener-like filter with the CTF. It gives stronger low-resolution contrast and less noise, for viewing, picking and segmentation. The normal tomogram is kept. About 10 s on the GPU. |
| Deconvolution strength | 1.0 | Higher = stronger contrast boost. |
| SNR falloff | 1.0 | Higher = smoother result. |

Both use the defocus measured by CTF estimation. Without it, deconvolution
falls back to the target defocus in the mdoc and the log says so, and CTF
correction is skipped.

**Advanced**: extra batchruntomo directives (`key = value`, one per line) are
added to — and override — the preset. **Show directives for the selected
series** displays exactly what will be sent to batchruntomo. The directive
names are listed in `IMOD\com\directives.csv`.

## Running a batch

1. Tick the series to process on the Tilt series page (**Check all** /
   **Uncheck all**).
2. Press **Start** (bottom left). pyPrep first estimates the disk space the
   batch needs and warns if the output drive is too full. The app switches to the Log page; progress is
   shown in the Batch panel and in the table's Stacks/Tomogram columns.
3. **Cancel** stops after the current tilt (or stops IMOD).
4. When the batch ends, the Batch panel shows *Finished N series in X min*
   (green) or which series had problems (red), the taskbar button flashes, a
   Windows notification appears (useful for overnight batches), and the
   Results page opens on the tomogram — or, for several series, the Gallery.

The settings of each run are saved as `pyprep_settings_last_run.json` in the
output folder.

Approximate times on a Quadro M4000 (46-tilt K3 series, 5760 x 4092, 4
fractions per tilt): frame alignment and bin 1 + bin 4 stacks ~40 s;
CTF estimation ~15 s; batchruntomo at bin 4 ~2 min; deconvolution ~10 s.
Writing large stacks is often limited by disk speed.

## Results page

![Results page](images/results.png)

- **Show**: the deconvolved tomogram and the tomogram (if reconstructed), and
  every stack written. Stacks are
  loaded in the background (a progress bar appears); large full-resolution
  stacks are shown reduced for speed.
- The slider under the image steps through tilts (labelled with the tilt
  angle) or tomogram slices. The histogram on the right sets the contrast.
- **Plot selector** (above the plot), all against tilt angle unless noted:
  - frame drift;
  - intensity against the expected curve (QC);
  - frame alignment score;
  - **defocus per tilt**, where red marks tilts whose CTF fit resolution is
    much worse than the rest (thick ice, drift, contamination);
  - **CTF fit of the current tilt**, plotted against spatial frequency: the
    flattened spectrum with the fitted model. The rings should line up.

  In the tilt-angle plots, flagged tilts are red; click a point to jump to that
  tilt.
- **Frame trajectory**: the per-frame shifts of the current tilt (square = first
  frame), in Å.
- **Open in 3dmod**, **Open in etomo** (the batchruntomo project), **Open folder**.
- **Export TIFF…** saves the shown stack or tomogram as an 8-bit ImageJ TIFF
  with the pixel size in nm, for Fiji and segmentation tools.
- **Position tomogram…** fixes a tomogram that is tilted, off-centre, cut off or
  much thicker than the specimen (see below).
- **Redo reconstruction** runs batchruntomo again for this series with the
  current Reconstruction settings (for example after changing the preset or
  excluding tilts). It replaces the tomogram and any manual positioning.

After **Test on one tilt**, the slider shows the unaligned (0) and aligned (1)
sums of that tilt.

### Positioning a tomogram

IMOD's automatic positioning fails on some specimens (sparse particles, thin
films), leaving a fallback thickness. The *Position tomogram* window does the
same job as etomo's manual *Tomogram positioning* step, without leaving pyPrep:

1. **Make trial tomogram** (about 15 s) reconstructs the aligned stack at bin 2,
   thicker than the specimen (*Trial thickness*, 600 nm by default).
2. Two views appear: **XZ** (seen along Y) and **YZ** (seen along X). They show
   where the trial has fine detail, so the specimen is bright and empty ice or
   vacuum is dark. **Auto** places the lines for you.
3. Drag the **teal line** to the top of the specimen and the **amber line** to
   its bottom in *both* views. Drag the end points to follow a tilted
   specimen. The readout shows the specimen thickness, the tilt corrections, the
   Z shift and the final tomogram thickness, which is the specimen plus
   *Margin each side*.
4. **Rebuild tomogram with these boundaries** (about 30 s) writes the
   corrections into `tilt.com` and re-runs IMOD `tilt` and `trimvol`. The
   Results page and the Gallery thumbnail update.

**Restore original** goes back to batchruntomo's positioning. You can repeat the
steps: a new trial uses the current positioning, and the corrections add up.
The etomo project stays valid.

## Gallery page

A grid with one thumbnail per processed tilt series and its name underneath,
for choosing which data to take further. Each thumbnail is the average of the
10 central slices of the series' tomogram (series without a tomogram show their
0° tilt). Thumbnails are made automatically at the end of each series, and for
older results when the Gallery is opened.

- **Tick the box** next to a thumbnail to *keep* that series. Picks are saved in
  the output folder (`pyprep_selection.json`).
- **Double-click** a thumbnail to open that series on the Results page.
- **Size** changes the thumbnail size; **Refresh** rescans the output folder.
- **Save contact sheet…** writes one PNG with all thumbnails and names (kept
  series outlined), for notes or sharing; **Export kept list…** writes the
  names of the kept series to a text file.

## Log page

Everything pyPrep and IMOD report, including per-tilt drift, timing and any
warnings (missing tilts, positioning fallback, EER without a gain reference).
Each series also keeps its own `<name>_pyprep.log`.

## Continuing in etomo

- **After reconstruction**: open `<output>\<series>\imod_bin4\<series>.edf` in
  etomo (or press *Open in etomo*). It is a normal etomo project: inspect the
  alignment, fix fiducials, change positioning or thickness, and rerun any step.
- **Starting etomo yourself** on a pyPrep stack: choose `<series>.mrc` (or
  `_bin4.mrc`) as the dataset. The `.rawtlt` and `.mrc.mdoc` next to it give
  etomo the tilt angles, the tilt-axis rotation and, for dose weighting, the dose
  of every tilt (in stack order). Pixel size is in the MRC header.

## Tips

- **Test on one tilt** first on a new kind of data (new camera, new gain
  reference, new grouping).
- For EER data, if *Test on one tilt* shows a fine pattern or a grid of dark
  spots, the gain reference orientation is probably wrong — try the rotate/flip
  settings.
- Low drift is normal for many tilt series (a few Å per exposure); frame
  alignment then changes little, which is expected.
- Keep outputs on a local disk if possible; network shares are fine for input.
